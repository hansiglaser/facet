*FACET - Flexible Artifact Correction and Evaluation Toolbox for concurrelty recorded EEG/fMRI data*
============================================================

FACET is a modular toolbox for the fast and flexible correction and evaluation of imaging artefacts of concurrently recorded EEG datasets. FACET is implemented in Matlab and relies on the EEGLAB data structure (Delorme & Makeig 2004). The whole toolbox consists of a "Correction" and an "Evaluation" part. Within the "Correction" framework a selection of various algorithms for correcting imaging induced artefacts are provided: average artefact subtraction (AAS) (Allen et al. 2000), PCA based (Niazy et al. 2005) and adaptive template approaches (van der Meer et al. 2010; Moosmann et al. 2009).

Additionally, various pre- and post-processing steps are implemented like volume onset detection, sub-sample alignment or OBS and ANC. All steps are implemented in a modular fashion to allow flexible combinations of different approaches. The "Evaluation" part of FACET allows to assess the quality of the chosen correction approach and to compare different settings.

**Requirements**

FACET relies on the EEGLAB data structure (Delorme & Makeig 2004) available at http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/. To run the example scripts, one also needs to install the FASTR algorithm (Niazy et al. 2005) available as an EEGLAB plugin at http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/eeglab/fmribplugin.

**Documentation**

The Toolbox is extensively explained in the book `fMRI Artifact Correction in EEG and EMG Data: Introducing FACET: A Flexible Artifact Correction and Evaluation Toolbox for EEG/fMRI Data <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=3659376078>` and in my diploma thesis doc/thesis.pdf. Please see src/README for more information.

Additional documentation with sample scripts implementing the most common algorithms can be found in Glaser et al. (2013).
